# Hotel Inventory Management System

The Hotel Inventory Management System is a web application developed as a portfolio project for my study at ALX Software Engineering Program. It aims to streamline inventory management processes for hotels by providing features such as user management, product management, and the creation of purchase and issue orders. This system is designed to optimize inventory operations and increase productivity in hotel management.


## Features

- User Management: The system allows for user registration, login, and authentication. Different user roles can be assigned, such as admin and regular users.

- Product Management: Hotels can manage their inventory by adding, editing, and deleting products. Each product can have attributes such as name, category, quantity, price, and reorder level.

- Purchase and Issue Orders: Hotels can create purchase orders to order new products and issue orders to record the usage or disposal of products. The system tracks the inventory changes and provides a history of orders.


## Technologies Used

- Flask: A Python web framework used for developing the backend of the application.

- SQLAlchemy: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database management in Python.

- PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system.

- HTML/CSS abd Bootstrap: Used for the frontend design and styling of the application.


## Getting Started

To run the Hotel Inventory Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the database connection details in the `config.py` file.

4. Run the application using the command `flask run`.
